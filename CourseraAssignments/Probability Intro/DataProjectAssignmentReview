Data Project of Week 5
---------------------
Data

1. Generalizability: Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on generalizability.
  -Did the author describe the sampling method, mentioning that a random sample was used?
  -Did the author decide that the results can be generalized to the US population?


2.  Causality: Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on causality.
  -Did the author decide that no random assignment was used, and hence causality cannot be inferred?

Questions  
  
3. Research Question: Is the research question phrased in a non-causal way?
  -Is the research question well defined / not vague? Note: "Well defined" means it is obvious from the research questions which variables will be    involved in the analysis.
  -Is it clear why this research question is of interest to the author and/or the reader?
  -Is the research question phrased in a non-causal way?
  -Do at least two of the research questions involve three variables?
  
EDA for Research Question
  
4. Plots
  -Do the plots address the research questions?
  -Are the plots constructed correctly?
  -Are the plots formatted well? (Size not too large, not too small, etc.)

5. SUMMARY STATISTICS
  -Do the summary statistics address the research question?
  -Are the summary statistics calculated correctly?
  -Are the summary statistics formatted well? (Not taking up pages and pages, etc.)
  
6. NARRATIVE
  - Is each plot and R output accompanied by a narrative?
  - Does the narrative interpret the visuals and summary statistics correctly?
  - Does the narrative address the research question?
